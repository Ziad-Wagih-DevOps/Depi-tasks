# Docker Training Task-1

This folder contains two main parts completed during Docker learning under the supervision of Eng. Ali Saleh. The task demonstrate working with Docker images, containers, and running applications inside Docker.

* **Part 1:** Worked with Nginx (pull, save, load, modify, commit, run custom image).
