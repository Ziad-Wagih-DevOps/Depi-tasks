# Docker Training Task-1

This repository contains two main parts completed during Docker learning under the supervision of Eng. Ali Saleh. The tasks demonstrate working with Docker images, containers, and running applications inside Docker.

---

* **Part 1:** Worked with Nginx (pull, save, load, modify, commit, run custom image).
* **Part 2:** Built and ran Spring PetClinic both locally and in Docker.

These tasks provided hands-on experience with Docker images, containers, ports, and running Java applications inside containers.
